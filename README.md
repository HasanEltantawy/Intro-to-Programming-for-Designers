# Introduction to Programming for Designers

This repo includes exercise files used in a workshop I ran in 2018.

The workshop built up on a single circle packing exercise, adding to it different functionalities and along the way explaining object oriented programming. Processing framework was used for this, but the concepts can be used anywhere else.

# Folders
Ex_001: Different primitive data types in processing.
Ex_002: Data structures and for loops.
Ex_003_Arrays: Data structures cont., ArrayLists syntax in Processing.
Ex_Circle: Basic functions/methods.
